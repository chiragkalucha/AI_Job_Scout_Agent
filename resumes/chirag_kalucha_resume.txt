PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE   
 Ministry of Home Affairs, Delhi                                                                                                            June 2025 – December 2025    
AI and Data Analyst Intern  
•	Reduced onboarding time for oceanographic analysts from 3-4 weeks to <8 hours by developing an interactive acoustic simulator deployed on the department's intranet. Enabled hands-on learning of domain concepts and sensor technologies across 5 departmental workstations. 
•	Integrated Hugging Face transformer models into the simulator to enable real-time spectrogram interpretation, providing automated acoustic pattern recognition that eliminated manual analysis bottlenecks for junior researchers. 
Internsellite, Sohna, India                                                                                                                                            Jun 2024 - Aug 2024     
Data Science Intern   
•	Identified $15000+ in potential monthly revenue optimization opportunities by analysing 20,000+ Amazon sales transactions using SQL and Python, discovering geographic clusters with 30%+ higher customer satisfaction rates for targeted product placement strategies. 
•	Built automated data preprocessing pipelines in Python (Pandas, NumPy) that reduced manual data cleaning effort by approximately 60%, enabling faster iteration on analytical insights for business stakeholders. 
PROJECTS    
E-Commerce Funnel Analysis & Churn Prediction System with Automated Engagement Optimization  
(Python, PostgreSQL, Faker, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Docker, Streamlit, Cohort Analysis, A/B Testing) 
•	Architected an end-to-end analytics pipeline to reduce customer drop-off rates by 22% across the conversion funnel by engineering a synthetic e-commerce dataset (500K+ user sessions) with Python Faker, modelling realistic user journeys through registration, browsing, cart addition, and checkout stages. 
•	Developed a multi-model churn prediction system using Random Forest and XGBoost achieving 89% recall on high-risk user identification, enabling proactive intervention campaigns targeting users with >70% churn probability before session abandonment. 
•	Dockerized the entire stack (PostgreSQL database, ML models, Streamlit dashboard) and deployed on GitHub with CI/CD pipelines for reproducible deployment, reducing setup time from days to <15 minutes for new analysts joining the project. 
Oceanographic Geospatial Analytics & Sensor Deployment Optimization System 
(Python, GeoPandas, Shapely, Folium, Streamlit, K-Nearest Neighbor) 
•	Processed and analysed 5GB+ of geospatial CTD (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth) sensor data covering 4 million+ coordinate points across the Indian Ocean to identify critical data gaps and prioritize sensor deployment zones for oceanographic research authorities. 
•	Identified 6 distinct deviation categories between ground-truth bathymetry and open-source aggregated datasets, revealing ±15-30% variance in the western Indian Ocean (East Africa corridor) and Indonesian archipelago belt. 
•	Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard with real-time heatmap visualizations using Folium, enabling stakeholders to explore data density patterns across regional grids and make data-driven decisions on exploration priorities; deployed for daily operational use by government research teams. 
 
ACHIEVEMENTS AND RECOGNITION 
•	Smart India Hackathon 2024 National Finalist – Selected among top 0.5% of 15,000+ participating teams nationwide for government-sponsored innovation challenge addressing real-world societal problems. 
•	Published 3 peer-reviewed research papers: "Multi-Agent AI Framework for Developer Assistance" (ICDAM Conference), "Comparative Evaluation of ML Algorithms for Bank Fraud Detection" (Wiley Library), and filed patent for "Virtually Aided Cashing Machine" (Patent Pending).  
•	Department Representative – Career Development & Training, Chandigarh University 
•	Chief Executive – Events & Programs, CAC Club 
•	Coursera Campus Ambassador coordinating 500+ students for skill development initiatives.  
•	Certifications: Python for Data Science (IBM), Applied Machine Learning in Python (University of Michigan), Generative AI for Data Analytics (Microsoft) via Coursera.
